Question 1 :-> Which Algorithm I used in this solution ?
Answer 1   :-> The Algorithm used in this solution is known as Dynamic Programing.
               it is a bottom-up approach where i calculate the minimum number of planes
               required to reach each airport by iterating over all possible paths from
               each airport to the final airport. We use a one-dimensional array to store
               the minimum number of planes required for reaching each airport, which is 
               updated as we iterate over the array.

Question 2 :-> What is the Time Complexity of this code ?
Answer 2   :-> The Time Complexity of the code is O(N^2). Reason -> ("I'm using a "Nested FOR Loop" to iterate
                                                                        over all possible paths from each airport
                                                                        to final airport");

Question 3 :-> What is the Space Complexity of this code ?
Answer 3   :-> The Space Complexity of the code is O(N). Reason -> ("I'm using an array of size N to store the
                                                                        minimum number of planes required 
                                                                        for reaching final airport");

Ouestion 4 :-> Why i inititalize variable planesRequired array with Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ?
Answer 4   :-> The Reason is that i want to store the minimum number of planes required to reach each airport.
               so by inititalizing it with a very large number, I'm sure that any other value will be smaller
               than this, and I can update the minimum number of planes required for each airport as I iterate
               over the array.

And in Else Case if we didn't able to reach last airport then we directly return -1 ,  by,
checking if the value of planesRequired[N-1] is still Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER after the
iteration is completed.
